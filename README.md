# Substitution

The goal of this program is for the user to input a key through command line, and a plaintext. The program needs to output a cipher based on key and maintext. This program has a couple issues but the main issue is the "key" variable gets wiped and becomes an empty string in the for loop that creates the cipher. You can find that loop beneath the validation and pseudo code written in the comments above it.
